            DESCRIPTION <br><br>

            Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch. If the current branch is behind the remote, then by default it will fast-forward the current branch to match the remote. If the current branch and the remote have diverged, the user needs to specify how to reconcile the divergent branches with --rebase or --no-rebase (or the corresponding configuration option in pull.rebase). <br><br>

            More precisely, git pull runs git fetch with the given parameters and then depending on configuration options or command line flags, will call either git rebase or git merge to reconcile diverging branches. <br><br>
            
            <repository> should be the name of a remote repository as passed to git-fetch[1]. <refspec> can name an arbitrary remote ref (for example, the name of a tag) or even a collection of refs with corresponding remote-tracking branches (e.g., refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*), but usually it is the name of a branch in the remote repository. <br><br>
            
            Default values for <repository> and <branch> are read from the "remote" and "merge" configuration for the current branch as set by git-branch[1] --track. <br><br>
            
            Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "master": <br><br>
            
                  A---B---C master on origin <br>
                 / <br>
                D---E---F---G master <br>
                ^ <br>
                origin/master in your repository <br><br>
            
            Then "git pull" will fetch and replay the changes from the remote master branch since it diverged from the local master (i.e., E) until its current commit (C) on top of master and record the result in a new commit along with the names of the two parent commits and a log message from the user describing the changes. <br><br>
            
                  A---B---C origin/master <br>
                 /         \ <br>
                D---E---F---G---H master <br><br>
            
            See git-merge[1] for details, including how conflicts are presented and handled. <br><br>
            
            In Git 1.7.0 or later, to cancel a conflicting merge, use git reset --merge. Warning: In older versions of Git, running git pull with uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it leaves you in a state that may be hard to back out of in the case of a conflict. <br><br>
            
            If any of the remote changes overlap with local uncommitted changes, the merge will be automatically canceled and the work tree untouched. It is generally best to get any local changes in working order before pulling or stash them away with git-stash[1].
