            DESCRIPTION <br><br>
            
            Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes. The new commit is a direct child of HEAD, usually the tip of the current branch, and the branch is updated to point to it (unless no branch is associated with the working tree, in which case HEAD is "detached" as described in git-checkout[1]). <br><br>
            
            The content to be committed can be specified in several ways: <br><br>
            
            by using git-add[1] to incrementally "add" changes to the index before using the commit command (Note: even modified files must be "added"); <br><br>
            
            by using git-rm[1] to remove files from the working tree and the index, again before using the commit command; <br><br>
            
            by listing files as arguments to the commit command (without --interactive or --patch switch), in which case the commit will ignore changes staged in the index, and instead record the current content of the listed files (which must already be known to Git); <br><br>
            
            by using the -a switch with the commit command to automatically "add" changes from all known files (i.e. all files that are already listed in the index) and to automatically "rm" files in the index that have been removed from the working tree, and then perform the actual commit; <br><br>
            
            by using the --interactive or --patch switches with the commit command to decide one by one which files or hunks should be part of the commit in addition to contents in the index, before finalizing the operation. See the “Interactive Mode” section of git-add[1] to learn how to operate these modes. <br><br>
            
            The --dry-run option can be used to obtain a summary of what is included by any of the above for the next commit by giving the same set of parameters (options and paths). <br><br>
            
            If you make a commit and then find a mistake immediately after that, you can recover from it with git reset.
