            DESCRIPTION <br><br>

            Shows the commit logs. <br><br>

            List commits that are reachable by following the parent links from the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s) given with a ^ in front of them. The output is given in reverse chronological order by default. <br><br>

            You can think of this as a set operation. Commits reachable from any of the commits given on the command line form a set, and then commits reachable from any of the ones given with ^ in front are subtracted from that set. The remaining commits are what comes out in the commandâ€™s output. Various other options and paths parameters can be used to further limit the result.
